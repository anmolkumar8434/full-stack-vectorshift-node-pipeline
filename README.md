# full-stack-vectorshift-node-pipeline
This project is a technical  for VectorShift, building a node-based pipeline editor with React and FastAPI. It includes reusable node abstractions, styled UI components, a dynamic Text node with variable-based handles, and backend integration to count nodes, edges, and verify whether the pipeline forms a DAG.
